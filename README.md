# Graph-implementation-adjacency-matrix
This is my first own version of implementing the Graph data structure using an adjacency matrix, it contains the basic Graph functions and subclasses. I was inspired by the book "Data structures and algorithms" by T. Goodrich in which they used the adjacency map while I transformed it to an adjacency matrix.
